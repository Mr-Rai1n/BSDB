## FAQ :

Q1) I'm unable to join lobby after modifying bsdb or nifs. What's wrong?

A1) The game implements checks for modified files both in BSDB and outside of it like nifs. I have developd a bypass for it. You can DM me.

Q2) If i modify Items, Are they visible for everyone?

A2) Items are only visible to you but the animation effects you switch to are the original weapon's.

Q3) I want to encrypt and decrypt BSDB to edit it on my own. is that possible?

A3) Yes, the tool provides the option to Encrypt and Decrypt BSDB for you to modify without using the other features.

 ### It's worth noting that this tool requires a Bypass for Items, Nifs and BSDB checks that the game implements on both client and server side. This of course excluding any 3rd party detection measures like the ones enforced by BattlEye (e.g : streamed shellcode) among many other things that may halt or defeat the purpose of this tool that's why : **USE AT YOUR OWN RISK**.
